            <p class="title-description">Veda is co-owned by two enthusiastic and dedicated professional women. Between them they have over 40 years of experience working in the environmental field. Hilary and Sarah formed Veda in 2008 out of both a frustration and a passion — a frustration about how inefficient much of the processes were around environmental issues and a passion to work in a manner that actually made a positive difference for the environment.</p>
